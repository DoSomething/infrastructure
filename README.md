# DoSomething.org Infrastructure

This is DoSomething.org's infrastructure as code, built using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io). We use it to manage and provision resources in [Fastly](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/fastly/), [Heroku](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/heroku/), and [AWS](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/) (EC2, RDS, SQS, S3, IAM users, amongst others). It's a [work in progress](https://github.com/DoSomething/internal/issues/465).

## Installation

Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) 0.12. On macOS, this is easy with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install terraform
```

Create a [Terraform Cloud account](https://app.terraform.io/account/new) with your work email & ask for an invite to our organization in [#dev-infrastructure](https://dosomething.slack.com/messages/C03T8SDJJ/). Don't forget to [enable two-factor auth](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/2fa.html)!  Then, [create your API token](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/users-teams-organizations/users.html#api-tokens) and place it in your `~/.terraformrc` file, like so:

```hcl
credentials "app.terraform.io" {
  token = "xxxxxx.atlasv1.zzzzzzzzzzzzz"
}
```

You can run `terraform format` at any time to format your code, or install the Terraform extension [for your editor](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/blob/main/docs/USAGE.md).

Alright, now you're ready to build some infrastructure!! üèó

## Usage

Terraform allows us to create & modify infrastructure declaratively. The files in this repository define what infrastructure (apps, databases, queues, domains, etc.) we _should_ have, and Terraform figures out what changes it needs to make the get there based on what currently exists.

We separate our configuration into workspaces. We also build re-usable modules in the [`applications/`](https://github.com/DoSomething/infrastructure/tree/main/applications) and [`components/`](https://github.com/DoSomething/infrastructure/tree/main/components) directories that can be re-used to provision the same type of thing in multiple places.

See Terraform's [Getting Started guide](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/build.html) & [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html) for more details.

### Plan

We use workspaces to separate different contexts (e.g. the main application vs. our data stack) and environments (proudction, QA, and development). Each workspace exists as a top-level folder in this repository.

To make changes in a workspace, first `cd` into the workspace's directory and run `terraform init` to pull down dependencies. Then, make your changes to the Terraform configuration files with your text editor.

You can **make a plan** to find out how your changes will affect the current state of the system:

```sh
make plan
```

Once you're satisfied with Terraform's plan for your changes, commit your work & make a pull request. Your pull request will automatically run a plan for all workspaces (even if they're not affected by your change).

### Apply

After your pull request is reviewed and merged, you can then **apply your change** to update the actual infrastructure. Terraform Cloud will make your changes, update the remote state, and ensure nobody else makes any changes until you're done.

To apply pending changes to a workspace, visit [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/app/dosomething/workspaces) and open the latest run for the workspace you want to modify. Review the plan & then choose "Confirm & Apply" to make the change.

## Security Vulnerabilities

We take security very seriously. Any vulnerabilities should be reported to [security@dosomething.org](mailto:security@dosomething.org),
and will be promptly addressed. Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose any issues you find.
