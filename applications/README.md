# Applications

These modules provision full applications, like [Northstar](https://github.com/DoSomething/infrastructure/tree/main/applications/northstar) or [Rogue](https://github.com/DoSomething/infrastructure/tree/main/applications/rogue). Each module should include all the [components](https://github.com/DoSomething/infrastructure/tree/main/components) needed by an application, such as databases or queues. Applications may be customized using variables, such as `environment`.
