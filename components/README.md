# Components

These modules provision components, like a [Heroku application](https://github.com/DoSomething/infrastructure/tree/master/components/heroku_app) or [S3 bucket](https://github.com/DoSomething/infrastructure/tree/master/components/s3_bucket). These are convenience wrappers around underlying Terraform resources, and allow us to follow the same best practices across applications.
